This project analyzes the gender gap in financial access in Kenya using the **FinAccess 2016 and 2021 datasets**.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Quantify the gender gap in **bank account ownership**
- Compare it with the gap in **mobile money usage**
- Track changes in usage across **2016–2021**
- Understand trends by **age** and **residence (rural/urban)**
- Identify key drivers behind shifts in financial access
